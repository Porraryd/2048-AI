The code is split in three files:

game.pyx contains the logic for the actual game. This includes logic to move the board, check for game over, score etc. 

rlagent.pyx contain the two agents, TDAgent and TDMiddlestateAgent. They can choose a move given some state (chooseMove), and can also learn from experience (learnEval). The classes are very similar and should probably have used inheritance. Some helper function are also here.

main.pyx is basically a main file, and is the file that should be executed. It will play games over and over again with the AI agent, giving stats after a certain amount of games. 

To run, compile with setup.cy using Cython, and then open a python environment and do "import main".
